# Decision Tree Cross Validation

## Steps

### Step I
* Downloaded the *Sensor Kinetics Pro* app to your [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sensor-kinetics-pro/id623633248?mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innoventions.sensorkineticspro&hl=en) device (or similar gyroscope measuring app)

### Step II
* Selected a physical activity that: a) can be measured using the app, b) has a concrrete, sontinuous, countable outcome and c) some members of the group are experts and some are novices at.
* Collected measurements for all members of the group performing the task using the app.
* Created a Github repo where you can store and share your data
* Used K-means to identify the novices from the experts using only the app data.
* Visualized the results using ggplot2.

### Step III
* Devised five questions on a five point Likert scale that ask about their experience with the chosen task.
* Collected data from all members of your group.
* Ran a PCA analysis on the data.
* Answered what PC1 represented in the analysis.
* Visualized PC1 results for each participant.

### Step IV
* If you could only choose one thing to predict the score for each member of your group (raw data variable, a cluster or a PC) what would it be and why?
* Create a visualization that supports your conclusion
* Based on your conclusion devise an intervention that would help novice members of your group imporve their performance
